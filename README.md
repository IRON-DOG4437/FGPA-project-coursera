# FGPA-project-coursera

This repository showcases a collection of FPGA-based projects developed during the **FPGA Capstone: Building FPGA Projects** course, part of the *FPGA Design for Embedded Systems Specialization* on Coursera. The course provided practical experience with digital and mixed-signal systems using the **DE10-Lite FPGA development board** and **Intel Quartus Prime** design suite.

Throughout the capstone, I worked on several real-world FPGA applications, including BCD arithmetic, PWM signal control, ADC interfacing, and System-on-Chip (SoC) development with the **NIOS II soft-core processor**.

## üî¢ Project 1: BCD Adder  
This project focused on designing a **Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) Adder** using the DE10-Lite board.  
Key tasks included:  
- Configuring the MAX10 FPGA using **System Builder**  
- Writing and simulating the Verilog design  
- Testing functionality on hardware  
- Documenting all observations in a structured lab notebook

## ‚ö° Project 2: Mixed-Signal System with ADC & PWM  
Here, I built a **mixed-signal circuit** that combined analog input and digital control.  
Features:  
- Read analog voltage levels using the built-in **ADC module**  
- Control an output signal with a **PWM generator**  
- Used Quartus Prime‚Äôs tools for design entry, simulation, and verification

## üîß Project 3: System on a Chip with NIOS II  
This project involved building a custom **System-on-Chip (SoC)** using the **NIOS II soft processor**:  
- Integrated peripherals and memory using **Qsys (Platform Designer)**  
- Compiled the SoC design and connected it within a top-level HDL wrapper  
- Prepared the hardware environment for software development  

---

## üíª Project 4: Software for the NIOS II System  
I programmed the embedded software for the NIOS II-based system using:  
- **NIOS II Software Build Tools (SBT)** within the Eclipse IDE  
- C programming to interface with hardware components  
- Uploaded both software and hardware configurations onto the FPGA for validation
